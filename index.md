Got back from New York to Los Angeles five days ago. Finished exam well today. Professor asked how I was doing. He also wished my health getting better. Bumped into an old teammate. Very glad to catch up with him. Able to sat at my most favorite seat in the cafeteria: out in the balcony, fresh air, quite. Able to eat lunch properly with chicken teriyaki and veggie spring rolls. Co-hosted a workshop with an alumni for the club. Great info. Best lesson: know thyself. I know that I am not good at Github and coding yet, and I am happy that I am making steps and spending time in improving it. My heart was full while going through this Making a Github page tutorial. Just a small step in taking care of myself and my personal growth. 🪴
