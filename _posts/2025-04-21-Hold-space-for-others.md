I had the grieve group support session today. I am grateful for the group, as it serves as an outlet for me to share my thoughts, doubts, regrets, loves, tears, and memories--things that I hardly verbally express or think about. I remember the way the therapist looking at me. It was just a full-attention look lasting a few minutes, yet it was a look that full of empathy and caring--a look that I myself had a hardtime to grasp as her look reflected how severe she thought my case was. She told me to stay behind to check in with me. I told her I am doing alright, with a smile on my face. I told her nobody every gave that look to me before--a look that both comfort yet making me become very self-conscious. I guess I am on the journey to learn how to sit with, go around with, and grow up with my grieve in a more healthy way. I had either laughed it off, brushed it off, burried if off, pressed it down, trying to ignore it for too long, until I brusted into tears with my roommate at 1am for things that happened five years ago. Every wounds, whether physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual, need to be taken care of. I am happy that I made that phone call to book an assessment with the CAPS, even it took me three months to have energy to do it. I am in a better mood and a better place now, and I learned how to take care of myself. I realized that I love eating raspberry and drinking mint tea a lot. Thank you Annie and Rachel.
