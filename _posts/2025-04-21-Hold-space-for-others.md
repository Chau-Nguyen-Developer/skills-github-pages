I had the grief group support session today. I am grateful for the group, as it serves as an outlet for me to share my thoughts, doubts, regrets, loves, tears, and memories--things that I hardly verbalize or think about. I remember the way the therapist looked at me. It was just a full-attention look lasting a few minutes, yet it was a look that was full of empathy and caring--a look that I  had a hardtime grasping, as her gaze reflected how severe she thought my case was. She told me to stay behind to check in with me. I told her I am doing alright. I told her nobody every gave that look to me before--a look that both comfort yet made me very self-conscious. I guess I am on a journey to learn how to sit with, go around with, and grow up with my grieve in a healthier way. I had either laughed it off, brushed it off, burried if, pressed it down, or tried to ignore it for too long, until I brusted into tears with my roommate at 1am for things that happened five years ago. Every wounds, whether physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual, needs to be taken care of. I am happy that I made that phone call to book an assessment with the CAPS at school, even it took me three months to muster the energy to do it. I am in a better mood and a better place now, and I learned how to take care of myself. I realized that I love eating raspberry and drinking mint tea a lot. Thank you, Annie and Rachel.
