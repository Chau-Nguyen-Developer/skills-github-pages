Got back from New York to Los Angeles five days ago. Had a very bad whezzing cough after the trip. Flew a lot in the past two weeks. Finished exam well today. Feel really supportive by group study. Professor asked how I was doing. He also wished my health getting better ‚≠ê. Bumped into an old teammate. Very glad to catch up with him. Able to sat at my most favorite seat in the cafeteria: out in the balcony, fresh air, quite. Able to eat lunch properly with chicken teriyaki and veggie spring rolls. Co-hosted a workshop with an alumni for the club. Great info. Best lesson: know thyself. I know that I am not good at Github and coding yet, and I am happy that I am making steps and spending time in improving it. My heart was full while going through this Making a Github page tutorial. Just a small step in taking care of myself and my personal growth. ü™¥
